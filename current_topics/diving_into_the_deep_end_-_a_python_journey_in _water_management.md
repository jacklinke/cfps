# Flow State: Building a Water Utilities Management Platform with Python

## Abstract / Elevator Pitch (300 characters)

Six years ago, I was asked to create a better Excel spreadsheet to track water requests for a small irrigation district. That request sparked an unexpected journey: from knowing only basic Python syntax to building a SaaS platform that models physical water delivery systems. This platform now handles water accounting, delivery tracking, scheduling, reporting, and even simulation for real-world use.

In this talk, I’ll share how I tackled challenges like:
- Transitioning from spreadsheets to a Python-powered solution.
- Modeling physical systems without a background in discrete mathematics, graph theory, or simulation.
- Scaling a personal learning project into a production-ready SaaS application.

I’ll also explore the tools and techniques that made it possible, the lessons I learned along the way, and the moments of failure and success that shaped my journey. Whether new to Python, considering tackling a big project, or just curious about real-world applications of Python, this talk will inspire attendees to dive in and solve problems beyond their comfort zone.

## Audience Level

Beginner to Advanced

## Outline

# 1. Intro (5 minutes)
   - Background: I have long been an Excel power user.
   - Problem: Inefficiencies in tracking water orders for a small irrigation district using Excel.
   - Request: Create a better spreadsheet.
   - Opportunity: Discovering broader challenges in water resource management that Excel couldn’t solve.
   - Starting Point: Limited Python knowledge (basic syntax) and no experience in related fields like modeling or simulation.

# 2. The Journey (10 minutes)
   - Phase 1: Transitioning from Excel to Python:
     - Why Python? (Flexibility, libraries, and ease of learning. But most of all: the community)
     - Initial experiments with data modeling.
     - Learning Python while solving specific problems.
   - Phase 2: Scaling to SaaS & Modeling Physical Systems:
     - Building the system with Django for web-based functionality.
     - Representing water delivery networks as graphs - first attempts.
     - Integrating geospatial data with tools like GeoDjango.
     - Designing user-friendly interfaces for water managers.
   - Phase 3: More powerful models:
     - Introduction to scheduling algorithms for water delivery.
     - First attempts at simulation: successes and failures.

# 3. Challenges and Lessons Learned (10 minutes)
   - Technical Challenges:
     - Overcoming knowledge gaps in discrete mathematics and graph theory.
     - Handling complex scheduling and simulations.
     - Scaling the application for real-world use.
   - Personal Challenges:
     - Dealing with imposter syndrome and moments of doubt.
     - Finding the balance between learning and building.
   - Lessons for Beginners:
     - You don’t need to know everything to start; just take the first step.
     - Real-world problems provide incredible motivation for learning.
     - Embrace failure—it’s a necessary part of growth.
     - Get involved in the community.

# 4. The Result (3 minutes)
   - Brief overview of our SaaS platform today:
     - Core features (water accounting, delivery tracking, scheduling, and simulation).
     - Real-world impact: adoption by irrigation districts.
   - Visual demo of how the system works (time permitting).

# 5. Takeaways and Inspiration (2 minutes)
   - Python is accessible and versatile, even for beginners tackling niche domains.
   - The journey matters as much as the destination—start small and keep learning.
   - Encouragement attendees to pursue ambitious projects!

## Notes

- I started this journey with no formal training in discrete mathematics, graph theory, or systems simulation. My Python experience was limited to basic syntax at the time. The talk draws from five years of hands-on learning, mistakes, and incremental progress.
- Relevance to PyCon:  
   - Appeals to beginners by demonstrating Python’s accessibility for solving complex, real-world problems.  
   - Inspires experienced developers, showcasing Python’s versatility in physical and geospatial modeling.  
   - Aligns with PyCon’s mission of fostering a supportive community and celebrating diverse paths into programming.
- The talk will include live visuals (system architecture diagrams, scheduling examples, and water delivery workflows) and anecdotes that make the technical content approachable.
- While the talk is about a commercial product, the focus is on the journey to build it and the technical aspects of the project. Nobody in the audience is a potential customer for our SaaS (it is solely marketed to irrigation districts), and my hope is that talking through what I built will help encourage others to build amazing things with Python.
