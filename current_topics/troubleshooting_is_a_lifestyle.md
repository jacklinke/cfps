# Troubleshooting is a Lifestyle ðŸ˜Ž

Updated version for PyCon 2025

# Abstract:

Troubleshooting isnâ€™t just a skill - itâ€™s a *mindset*, and in the world of Python, itâ€™s a superpower. Whether youâ€™re unraveling a runtime bug, optimizing a data pipeline, or resolving a tricky dependency conflict, the ability to systematically identify, isolate, and resolve problems is invaluable. But effective troubleshooting doesnâ€™t happen by accident - itâ€™s a practice you can learn and develop.

In this talk, weâ€™ll explore how to approach troubleshooting Python as a structured, repeatable process, but much of the advice applies to troubleshooting anything you might encounter. Youâ€™ll learn to:

- Identify and leverage built-in indicators, like exceptions, stack traces, and logging.
- Break down big problems into manageable pieces with tools like `pdb`, `logging`, and the REPL.
- Avoid common pitfalls like tunnel vision and fixed assumptions by stepping back and reassessing.
- Ask for help effectively, using clear context and minimal reproducible examples (MREs).
- Document your troubleshooting process for present clarity and future insights.

This talk isnâ€™t about memorizing fixes for specific bugsâ€”itâ€™s about equipping yourself with a universal troubleshooting framework, informed by Pythonâ€™s powerful and accessible ecosystem. Whether youâ€™re a beginner learning the ropes or a seasoned developer refining your craft, you will come away from the talk equipped with troubleshooting tools you can use.

# Reviewer Notes:
- The content of the talk is based on real-world troubleshooting experiences and best practices. I have experienced troubleshooting in electronics design, as a radar technician, in programming for most of my life, and in a number of other facets throughout my life.
- The goal of this talk is to equip participants with practical troubleshooting skills that they can apply in their professional and personal lives.
- While beginners and intermediate programmers will probably gain the most from my talk, I have found that some of the things I discuss may give experienced programmers new ways to look at troubleshooting, or remind them of things they may be overlooking as they work through problems.
