# Home on the range

## Abstract / Elevator Pitch (300 characters)

## Audience Level

- Intermediate - Participants should already be familiar with building projects in django.

## Objectives

## Outline

## Notes

Ranges (in queries and models) are something I struggled with for a long time. I eventually found that building complex queries with individual `start` and `end` fields was inconvenient and not very effective. Now I use ranges in dozens of places in my own apps. We will work through an example project that demonstrates a number of approaches to working with ranges. Working with ranges is a topic that is often glossed over. I had to do a lot of research to master working with ranges, and I hope to keep you from this misery.
