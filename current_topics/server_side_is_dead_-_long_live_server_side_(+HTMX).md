# Server-Side is Dead! Long Live Server-Side (+ HTMX)

## Abstract / Elevator Pitch (300 characters)

With no 'standard' approach to front-end other than the built-in templating and so many JS frontend frameworks and tools and options, it's easy to get thrown for a loop. HTMX lets us stick to what django is good at - server-side stuff, mainly - without feeling like we're missing out on modern tools.

## Audience Level

- Beginner to intermediate

## Objectives

By the end of this talk, audience members will have a better understanding of what HTMX is, will understand concrete examples of how it can be applied to their django projects, and will have a list of resources for further learning and discussion.
